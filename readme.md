Mood Bank:
http://p4.aridwo.me

Description of the project (2-3+ sentences):
Conventional scientific understanding is that there are six basic emotions – happy, sad, angry, scared, disgusted, and surprised. Mood Bank is an application that allows its visitors to partake in the full range of these 6 human emotions, or moods, by the sensory experience of viewing images. 

When visitors go to the homepage, they are greeted by 6 different facial expressions which    are each representatives for one of the six moods, by clicking on a face visitors are then redirected to all the images in the mood bank that convey the chosen mood. 

If a visitor signs up for an account, they will have access to these 3 website features that non-users do not: 
1) Access to "all images", which, when clicked in the header menu, allows users to view all photos in the mood bank
2) Editing the mood(s) associated with an image in the mood bank
3) The ability to add a new image to the mood bank.
